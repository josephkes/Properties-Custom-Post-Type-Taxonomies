# Properties Custom Post Type Taxonomies
A simple plugin that adds custom post types and taxonomies to a WordPress installation

More specifically this plugin was created for a real estate office that lists their properties on the frontend but also wish to manage them from the backend.

Two different Post Types are created, Residential and Commercial. Both include custom taxonomies Type, ID and Area in order to display along the property listing but also create a data set on which one can manage their properies through the Wordpress Admin Panel.

All Properties maintain the classic WP Categories Taxonomy to be used for further grouping of propeties. Thus, listings are  searchable by Type, ID, Area and also Category.

If you wish to make changes to the the post types, you have to manually dive in the code and ammend the labels and args.
